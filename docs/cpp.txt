C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that extends the C programming language with object-oriented features. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979, C++ is widely used for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

Key Features:
1. Object-Oriented Programming
2. Generic Programming through Templates
3. Low-level Memory Manipulation
4. High Performance
5. Direct Hardware Access
6. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

Core Language Elements:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures
- Functions and Methods
- Classes and Objects
- Templates
- Namespaces
- Exception Handling

Object-Oriented Features:
1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance (Single and Multiple)
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Data Abstraction
6. Friend Functions
7. Operator Overloading

Memory Management:
- Stack vs Heap Allocation
- new and delete Operators

Standard Template Library (STL):
1. Containers
   - Vector
   - List
   - Map
   - Set

Common Applications:
1. System Programming
2. Game Development
3. Real-time Systems
4. Embedded Systems
5. Performance-Critical Applications
6. Graphics Programming
7. Financial Systems

Development Tools:
- Compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Build Systems (CMake, Make)
- IDEs (Visual Studio, CLion)
- Debuggers (GDB, LLDB)

The C++ language continues to evolve with new standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20) adding modern features while maintaining backward compatibility and performance. Its combination of high-level abstractions and low-level control makes it uniquely suitable for a wide range of applications.
